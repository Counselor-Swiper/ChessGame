# ChessGame

I have been super addicted to chess lately so I figured it would be fun to make a long term project out of it. Below are a list of features on my bucket list to implement:

- Unit tested and bug free chess engine in c++
    - Instantiation of board
    - Checking legal moves
    - Game logic
    - ect.
- GUI with python and Pygame
    - Dragging/Dropping pieces
    - Highlighting legal moves
    - Supporting "Pass and play"
- Chess bot
    - Neural net
    - Montecarlo Search
    - Other helpful huristics
    - Hard coding openings?
- Game Review
    - Using my Bot or an open source to evaluate positions
    - Evaluate every position in a chess game and give feedback on every move
    - Chess.com has this but I think it could be doable
- Local host play
    - Ability for a player to host a game where someone on the same wifi network can use a seperate computer to play
